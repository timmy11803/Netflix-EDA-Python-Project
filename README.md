# Netflix Python EDA

In this project I utilized exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in Netflix user subscription data across multiple
years. My main purpose was to get an idea of which shows had the longest shelf life and to analyze the correlations among them, more specifically which shows were successful for more than the inital first season. I obtained my data set from a github repository then used SQL to parse and join the data to create the data set with all the proper parameters that I needed to do my EDA later in Python.

## Business Problem:

What makes Netflix's subscription based model so successful and why does usership continue to grow? How do they pick their database of shows and how do they attribute to Netflix's successful business model?

## Skills:

SQL: CTEs, Joins, Case, aggregate functions

Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Writing functions, statistics
